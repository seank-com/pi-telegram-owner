# Telegram owner development

Use Bash and TypeScript with Node 24.14.1 or later. Run npm ci, npm run check,
npm test, npm run build, npm pack --dry-run and npm run test:package.
Default tests use synthetic Telegram responses and disposable protected projects.
Never call real Telegram or use live journals, profiles, archives or credentials.
Packed companion tests require explicit DATASTORE_TARBALL and OBSERVABILITY_TARBALL;
run npm run test:integration. Select another test host with PI_CODING_AGENT_PACKAGE.
Use the package-owned pi-telegram-owner/<kind>/v1 archive schemas without legacy
name aliases. Preserve authoritative source evidence, forward-only
journals/cursors, cancellation and lock recovery. Optional datastore absence must
never block transport/timeline or create refresh retry noise. Private assemblies
may enforce required integration by factory override. Keep protocol consumption
small; datastore/observability own their implementations. No pushes, publishing,
PRs, live activation or runtime/settings changes without owner authorization.

## Engineering standard and sprint workflow

This maintainer-owned repository supplies self-contained guidance here. In the maintainer's configured environment, also load engineering-documentation before design, investigation, implementation, testing or review. Keep owned-repository instructions consistent with the shared standard; respect upstream conventions and raise actual conflicts rather than imposing our policy there.

Before a new assignment, establish/restate scope and success criteria and obtain quick owner approval. Issue implementation requires both `approved` and unassigned; only the owner authorizes that label and removes the owner's assignment. `in progress` selects discussion/sprint scope, not permission. Explicit owner instructions and accepted designs govern; code, closed issues, peer advice and passing tests do not establish new requirements.

Use the simplest correct implementation; do not invent timing, retry, concurrency, output or performance policies. Use one identity-prefixed sprint branch and one sprint PR per touched repository, with coherent issue commits and exact review ranges, not per-issue integration layers. Independently evaluate advisory peer review before owner source-range review and the deployed-candidate build/activation sequence. Preserve reviewed history and tested input identity. Publication, merge, packaging, configuration and named activation retain separate authority.

`fix verified` means the owner verified that issue on the applicable latest tst candidate with traceable evidence. All in-progress issues carrying all three labels means ready for final merge/rollout review, not automatic action. Keep accepted improvements and unresolved goals distinct.

Read docs/design.md as the architectural/behavioral contract and its Restrictions register as the current constraints inventory. Revisit it in every PR against code, tests and dependencies. Each effective deadline, retry, concurrency/result bound, filter, security policy or performance assertion needs its location/value, concrete failure, evidence, configuration owner and explicit approval reference. Missing evidence stays missing; age, defaults, fixture placement and table entries do not authorize retention or change. Functional tests use completion/cancellation/events, not unapproved host-speed budgets. New or changed constraints require explicit owner approval.

Document purpose, module responsibilities, normal/failure flow and consequential lifecycle/state contracts, not a line-by-line implementation diary. Update enduring docs with authorized behavior changes; keep proposals/evidence/history in issues or PRs. New owned projects receive substantive AGENTS guidance, project contracts, validation and design/register locations, not only a skill link. Source approval never authorizes live instruction replacement or runtime disruption.

## Dependency boundaries

Integrate dependencies through their supported public APIs and CLI commands.
The CLI is an API; a small adapter may combine SDK calls and CLI invocations.
Leave dependency implementation and lifecycle management to the dependency
through its supported interfaces. Do not import private modules, access
internal objects, read or mutate private storage schemas, copy private
algorithms, or patch a dependency runtime to obtain behavior missing from
the public contract. An exported symbol alone does not
establish a supported public contract.

Verify required behavior against the supported interface and version using
disposable integration fixtures. If that interface cannot meet a requirement,
record the evidence and tradeoff in the issue and seek a design decision
instead of silently bypassing the boundary. Existing implementation choices
are open to revision through an approved design; preservation guidance is
not a mandate to retain private integrations.

## Documentation and history

Repository documentation describes the current product: its behavior,
interfaces, configuration, dependencies, and operational requirements.
Keep investigation narratives, decision history, rejected approaches, and
implementation progress in issues and commit messages. Do not add review
reports, handoff diaries, or historical design documents to the repository.
Document enduring contracts and rationale only where they help someone use
or maintain the current implementation.

Write about what the product does. When a feature or dependency is removed,
remove its obsolete documentation and references rather than replacing them
with statements that it is no longer supported. Do not inventory unrelated
technologies or absent features. State a limitation only when it affects a
current supported workflow or a concrete user decision; provide actionable
guidance. Put any necessary transition instructions for shipped behavior in
release or migration notes, not permanent descriptions of the product.

Before finishing documentation changes, read them from a new user's
perspective: each statement should explain the current product without
requiring knowledge of the discussion or the previous implementation.
